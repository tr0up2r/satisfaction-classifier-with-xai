Everyone - and I do mean *everyone* - that I know likes to either take pictures of themselves or have pictures of them be taken. Most people's social media profiles are filled with their own face - which is not a bad thing in any way, in fact it's wonderful they're confident in who they are. But even the quieter, sadder looking people I've met still like to show off images of themselves. Which, I guess, goes to show, that you have to be in a pretty bad place and have a significantly low image of yourself to never once consider wanting to display your own face to the rest of the world.

I broke down (tears and all) to my boss and let him know how uncomfortable I've been working in his company.
