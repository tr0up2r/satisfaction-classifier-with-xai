      "Third year college student. My depression has always stemmed largely from social anxiety, wishing I had friends but not knowing how to make them. I spent two years in dorms and never spoke to any of my neighbors and didn't really meet anybody.\n",

      "Last night, for the first time in my life, I was invited to a party (not personally mind you; I was a part of a group that got collectively invited). I drank a little bit, but got tipsy quickly, and not knowing my limits I stopped. I was completely sober within the first hour. \n",

When she is depressed, she starts insulting me and saying not nice things to me. She explained, that because of her depression, she can't control her feelings. I am very supportive to her and when she feels down, i always remind her that i love her and if she wants us to meet we can do it or have a video chat. Lately, if i say something nice, she says: you want this relationship more than me and you are desperate for a relationship, that's why you said that. When i give her space, she gets angry that I don't trust her. Any advise? Also, do people with depression insults the ones they love? \n",

      "Hello. I have had insecurities, anxiety, depression and trust issues all my life. Between September and December I started smoking pot very often. I stopped for awhile and  started again in January. I had a problem smoking everyday to the point where I felt dead inside, emotionless. I felt like nothing was real. I haven't smoked since February, but I have had some personal issues and I'm trying to develop into a better person. Sometimes I get so depressed that I have suicidal thoughts and don't eat. I still feel like nothing is real at times. I feel disconnected from everyone and everything, even myself. I started going to therapy but I need more help. I am just so confused about everything to the point where it scares me. I don't know how to explain but it's like my subconscious mind is in control. It's like I'm in the \"sunken place\" (Get Out reference). I feel like I don't understand myself or anything for that matter. Life is so confusing to me I just feel so alone. Can anyone explain to me what I'm going through? Has anyone gone through this before? How can I make my life better? Thank you.\n",

But every time I come home from work and find he's done nothing about it I feel like screaming at him and crying. He's told me sometimes he can't even find the will to live. I know it's hard on him and I'm trying really hard to help him without being patronizing/ a bitch about it, but Im really at a loss of what to do now. He doesn't pay rent, money isn't an issue as he lives with my mum and I but we've talked about getting our own place but it's not like anything can be done until he's got a steady income or is at least heading in the right direction.

      "I have been listening to the book [\"The Body Keeps the Score\"](http://www.amazon.com/Body-Keeps-Score-Healing-Trauma/dp/0670785938) and realized that my diagnosis of PTSD is not accurate. I grew up with domestic violence - simply diagnosing me with PTSD ignores the impact of childhood trauma on the developing child. With PTSD survivors, they have a former self (pre-trauma) with a set of core values and schemas that are not impacted by trauma. But with DTD survivors, we don't have a pre-trauma self because the trauma(s) happened when our brains were still developing as children. All of my core values/schemas have been developed around trauma.  I actually feel so lost now... I feel hopeless and permanently broken.\n",

It came with severe depression and anxiety. And the other side of it was the great feelings of mania. Anyways, i have been going to the psyc and taking meds now for years to try and stabilze my moods. It just kind of occured to me that i am just flat out tired and exausted...All of the time. No energy whatsoever. And i know it has to do with my meds. We have tried several different kinds but only with the same effect. I was a very athletic and artistic person before my meds. I guess my question is that... if anyone who is bipolar or suffers from the same symptoms has succesfully came off meds and stayed in a generally good state of health..how did you go about it. And what are your routines to stay stable and healthy minded. Sorry for the length...any answers would be appreciated. Thanks guys\n",

What hurts is that nobody ever touched me, never held my hand. I've never experienced a hug. At night I crawl up in my bed, go to fetal position and just cry. Sometimes press my body against a pillow, just to feel a bit heavy on my chest - like someone's pressing against it. Sometimes I just close my eyes, reach out with my hand imagining a girl beside me and I'm touching her. Nothing sexual, just imagine myself holding her hand. I do watch porn, not that regularly but time to time. But it hurts. Actually not just porn, anything as little as seeing two people holding hands makes me sad. I just wish I could experience something like that, I just wish for once I could be loved. I wish I could have someone beside me, to cuddle, to wrap my hand around, to feel her warmth.

I do not recall what the dosage was, but I don't think it was very much. During the last month or two of seeing that psychiatrist, he started me on lorazepam for anxiety. For unrelated reasons, I had to switch psychiatrists, and have been on citalopram, buspirone, and lorazepam (sparingly) for the last few years. Lately I've been having some severely depressive episodes and my psychiatrist upped my citalopram dosage by 50%. I really hope it works. I would like some relief.\n",

That all went downhill and I started self harming again which helped. I then finally made the decision to go to therapy and my counsellor has been a huge help, he is understanding and he even inspired me to go see a doctor who prescribed me with fluoxetine. The pills don't feel like they are helping a lot right now but I know they usually take a few months to kick in. I just wanted to share a bit of myself with people who understand. Also if anyone wants to talk, either PM me and we'll arrange a way to speak (anything you feel comfortable with) that would be great not just for me but I think it can help any of you as well. I sincerely hope someone takes me up on my offer so we can help each other heal.\n"
