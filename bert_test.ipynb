Available to me is stronger-than-OTC ibuprofen I was prescribed some months ago, as well as painkillers / cold medicine available from my university's store. Would mixing these with alcohol do the trick, and, if so, what should I expect?\\n2. How long would it take for me to die from hanging? I live in a single, though there's nothing in the room from which I could hang myself. I'm concerned that if I try to hang myself outside at night, someone might pass by, cut the rope, and leave me brain dead in a hospital bed.\\n3. Would standing in front of an Amtrak be particularly unpleasant / painful? Would I be knocked out immediately, or would it take a few minutes?

Yes I do.  And years ago I acted on it.  That experience made me realize that it\\'s not real and I will eventually get over it.  But I don\\'t know how to stop feeling this way and I think I need medication again.  I\\'m not good at lying.  The last time I went to see someone I ended up Baker Act and it cost me $3,000.  That\\'s depressing all by itself.  So here I am, I need help and I don\\'t know what to do.  Again, I am not going to hurt myself.  But I feel like I want to very much.

Thanks for all the support over the time I've browsed this sub, it really helped. \\n\\nTo anyone still struggling to find meaning with their life, take a deep breath and listen to your surroundings and know that they're real. Then remember that feeling next time you interact with another person young or old. Try to see things from their perspective, try to listen to what they're saying and most importantly, speak the truth, tell the others how you really feel and listen to what they say. They will understand you and know what you need to do to help yourself. If they don't understand, it's just because they can't because they have no idea what it's like to be you because YOU are YOU! I hope YOU get better too. I am legitimately getting worse. So I'm glad someone could climb out of the pit of disrepair. \",\n",

My room is already small, so I replaced my big furniture with smaller stuff to kind of make it look bigger.

Once I accepted that it wasn't my fate to commit suicide I moved on, found faith even in some sort of higher power that had a greater plan for me and I felt okay-ish for a while. That all went downhill and I started self harming again which helped.

The pills don't feel like they are helping a lot right now but I know they usually take a few months to kick in. I just wanted to share a bit of myself with people who understand.
